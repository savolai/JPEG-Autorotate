<p><strong>Ever had the problem of pictures taken in portrait showing up in landscape in emails, on your blog or on your mobile device? JPEG Autorotate is the solution. It's quick, it's simple, it's free.</strong></p>
<p>Photos from most digital cameras already contain the information needed to rotate photos the right way up. This little app uses that information to automatically make sure your photos show up correctly everywhere. No need to do this by hand anymore.</p>
<p><strong>Do you have Windows 8?</strong> I would currently like to hear if it is compatible. If you have tried JPEG Autorotate on it, please comment below if this works there, too! Thanks!</p>

<h2>Help, compatibility</h2>

      <h3>Usage</h3>

<p>Run the installer, follow the instructions. </p>

<p>When the installer is finished you should be able to 
right-click any folder or a file with .jpg or .jpeg 
extension. For folders, you should see the menu items 
"Auto-rotate all JPEGs in folder" and "Auto-rotate all 
JPEGs in folder and in all subfolders". For JPEG files, you 
should see the menu item "Auto-rotate".</p>

<p>Clicking any of the menu items should bring up a console, 
showing the progress of the auto-rotating process and 
telling you to "Press any key to continue . . ." when 
completed.</p>

<h3> Setting timestamps of rotated files</h3>

<p>As of version 1.2, during installation there 
are two choices with the "Set the timestamp of selected 
files to EXIF date" selection:</p>

<ul>
<li>Not selected (default): jpegtran will change the 
timestamp of all the rotated files to the current 
date and time (of rotating).</li>
<li>Selected: the date of <em>all the selected files, regardless of 
whether they have been rotated or not</em> will be changed to 
the moment of taking the photo, according to the EXIF 
metadata (jhead parameter -ft).</li>
</ul>


<h3> Compatibility</h3>

</p>
<p>Apparently this still works like magic for most people. If you have 
problems 
getting this work though, I may 
not be able to help, as I don't use Windows myself anymore but Ubuntu Linux.</p><p>
In addition to this, there is another one to try that seems to do similar magic: <a href="http://annystudio.com/software/jpeglosslessrotator/">JPEG 
Lossless Rotator</a>

<h3>Possible troublemaker: Photos with no Orientation tag</h3> <p>Some 
cameras do not store the orientation data at all, so JPEG-EXIF 
autorotate can't work at all. You can check if your photos contain the 
orientation data by entering a photo that should be portrait but has not 
been rotated yet, at <a href="http://exifdata.com/">exifdata.com</a>. On 
the results page, scroll to the bottom of the list to find 
"Orientation". If the Orientation value is "Horizontal (normal)", then 
the file you uploaded does not contain portrait orientation data - 
either because it never was in the file, or because it has been cleared, 
for example after already having been rotated.</p> 

<h3>Possible 
troublemaker: Write permissions</h3> <p> Another common problem is that 
you don't have write permissions to the photos/JPEG files or to the 
folder containing them, so JPEG Autorotate can not change the 
files.</p>

    <div id="details">
    <h2>Features</h2>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> With the default settings, all 
the rotated files will 
have their timestamp changed to the time and date at the moment of the 
operation. However, the datetime EXIF metadata inside the file will 
be preserved. You also have an option during the installation to have the 
app set the dates of all files to the EXIF datetime field's value. See 
readme.txt (below) for more info.</p>
<h3>What does it do?</h3>

<p>According to the EXIF orientation metadata stored in JPEG 
files by digital cameras, JPEG Autorotate losslessly 
rotates the files which are oriented wrong, usually by 90 
or 270 degrees.</p>

<p>"I own a canon ixus digital camera, which has the ability 
to save the orientation the camera was in while taking the 
picture in tag in the exif headers of the pictures, thanks 
to a gravity sensor. Exif-enabled software can read this 
tag and display the images the right side up, but these 
programs are still uncommon (well, photoshop does, but the 
standard windows image viewer doesn't. The solution I 
prefer is to rotate the images in the correct direction 
once and for all, and then I can forget about using exif 
enabled software" -Thomas Bonfort, the original writer of 
the batch files</p>

<p>The graphical user interface of the application is the 
right-click menu items in Windows. (Clicking any one of 
them will launch jhead with the appropriate command line 
parameters in a console window.) See "Acknowledgements" 
below for further details.</p>


<h3>Acknowledgements</h3>

<p>Some might consider the optimal solution to not touch the 
file timestamps at all. Unfortunately with jhead this is 
currently not possible.</p>

<p>As of version 1.2, IPTC metadata will be left intact. 
Earlier versions deleted all IPTC metadata due to a problem 
in jhead.</p>

<p>From the jhead documentation: "After rotation, the 
orientation tag of the Exif header is set to '1' (normal 
orientation). The exif thumbnail is also rotated as of 
Jhead version 2.5. Other fields of the Exif header, 
including dimensions are untouched, but the JPEG 
height/width are adjusted. This feature is especially 
useful with newer digital cameras, which set the 
orientation field in the Exif header automatically using a 
built in orientation sensor in the camera."</p>

<p>In some cases, the context menu entries will not be 
directly under the right click menu, but in the submenu 
"Open with..." If you know how to force it directly in the 
context menu, please tell me. <a href="http://pilpi.net/contact/">http://pilpi.net/contact/</a></p>

<p>From the jpegtran documentation: "The transpose 
transformation has no restrictions regarding image 
dimensions.  The other transformations operate rather oddly 
if the image dimensions are not a multiple of the iMCU size 
(usually 8 or 16 pixels), because they can only transform 
complete blocks of DCT coefficient data in the desired 
way." ... "For practical use, you may prefer to discard 
any untransformable edge pixels rather than having a 
strange-looking strip along the right and/or bottom edges 
of a transformed image.  To do this, add the -trim switch: 
-trim Drop non-transformable edge blocks."</p>

<p>The transformation is truly lossless - jhead is not using 
the -trim command line argument when calling jpegtran to do 
the actual rotating. With JPEG files coming straight out of 
a digital camera, I understand that the dimensions of the 
image dimensions usually are a multiple of the iMCU size, 
so no strange results should appear. Be careful when 
rotating "custom-sized" JPEGs though.</p>

<p>If you want to remove some menu items you already have 
installed, you need to uninstall the entire JPEG-EXIF 
autorotate via Control Panel -> Add/Remove Programs and 
then reinstall it with only the desired menu options 
selected.</p>

<h3>Developer Notes</h3>

<p>With version 1.2, the installer UI is getting a bit 
crowded. I couldn't be bothered to learn the relatively 
obscure NSIS scripting language well enough to create new 
option pages to move some of the options to. If you know 
how to achieve this or how to make the installer window 
bigger/resizable, please let me know :).</p>

<p>The compiling the installer with NSIS requires the 
InetLoad plugin, see credits.</p>

<p>The 1.2 installer also uses some files, which will not be 
placed "as is" to the final installation directory
when using the installer: autooperate<em>ft.bat,
autooperatedir</em>ft.bat and autooperatedir<em>recursive</em>ft.bat
These can be acquired by installing the scripts with 
"Set the timestamp of selected files to EXIF date"
selected, and then renaming the three batch files to
the above names. Of course you will also need the default
versions autooperate.bat, autooperatedir.bat 
and autooperatedir_recursive.bat, which will be 
installed if you leave the above option unselected.
The only difference with these two sets of files is that
the _ft versions have the -ft command line parameter
passed to jhead, in order to set the file dates
according to EXIF metadata.</p>

<p>Includes jhead and jpegtran compiled for Windows. See the 
installation directory, for default a folder called 
"JPEG-EXIF_autorotate" in the "Program Files" (or 
equivalent in local language).</p>

<h3>Todo</h3>

<ul>
<li>A feature to close the rotating window automatically when 
finished rotating has been requested a couple of times.</li>

    <div id="changelog">
<h2>Changelog</h2>

<h3>Changes</h3>
<p>Version 2.0/2013-05-21</p>

<p>Rebranded as JPEG Autorotate. 
Moved project to github, please see
<a href="https://github.com/savolai/JPEG-Autorotate/commits/master">commit history</a></p>

<p>Version 1.2/2007-07-28 (Using NSIS 2.29)</p>

<ul>
<li>Added an option to set the file dates to the date in
EXIF date field, which is supposed to be the photo taking
time/date. </li>
<li>Updated to a jhead post-2.7 head revision copy, to
avoid resetting the IPTC data of rotated files. Thanks to 
Matthias Wandel, the author of jhead, for compiling it for 
me on 2007-07-25.</li>
<li>Updated the documentation (this file), added Developer 
Notes.</li>
<li>Tested the installer with wine on Ubuntu Linux. It 
works. Not that it would be any use ;).</li>
<li>Made JPEG-EXIF autorotate version number visible in 
the installer title bar.</li>
</ul>

<p>Version 1.1/2006-05-06</p>

<ul>
<li>Updated jhead to version 2.6, which means that now 
JPEG-EXIF autorotate also rotates the thumbnails inside
JPEG images</li>
<li>Added a "regenerate thumbnails" feature, to fix the 
thumbnails of images rotated by previous versions of 
jhead or JPEG-EXIF autorotate. This feature uses 
mogrify.exe from Imagemagick. mogrify.exe is over 4 
megabytes, so the installer now downloads it only if
the user selects it for installation.</li>
<li>Added the URL of the JPEG-EXIF autorotate website in 
the beginning and in the end of the rotating process.</li>
</ul>

<p>Version 1.03/2006-01-05</p>

<ul>
<li>Updated the package with the new documentation</li>
<li>Added a note in the beginning and in the end of the 
rotating process</li>
</ul>

<p>Version 1.02/2004-05-21 
(just documentation - not yet updated in the installation 
file)</p>

<ul>
<li>Added 'acknowledgements' section
-- noting that jpegtran changes timestamps
-- describing the true lossless rotation that JPEG-EXIF 
autorotate does 
-- and noting that the orientation EXIF tag is set to '1'
(normal orientation) after rotation.</li>
</ul>

<p>Version 1.01/2004-04-24</p>

<ul>
<li>Cleaned up the NSI file, fixed the name of the 
application to "JPEG-EXIF autorotate", fixed some minor 
bugs, fixed errors in readme.txt</li>
</ul>

<p>Version 2004-04-22</p>

<ul>
<li>First release, 1.0</li>

<h3>Background</h3> <p>I used to have 
a Konica Minolta DiMAGE Z2 camera, which lets me rotate 
photos, but actually it doesn't <em>really</em> rotate them. It 
just edits the EXIF orientation metadata in the JPEG file. </p><p>I found a solution by Thomas Bonfort that turned the EXIF data into a rotated photo, enhanced it to work in most 
Windows machines and made a Windows 
installer with <a href="http://nsis.sourceforge.net" 
class="external">NSIS</a>. Uses <a 
href="http://sylvana.net/jpegcrop/" class="external">jpegtran</a>, 
<a href="http://www.sentex.net/~mwandel/jhead/" 
 class="external">jhead</a> and <a 
href="http://www.imagemagick.org/"
 class="external">ImageMagick</a>. Some parts compressed with <a 
href="http://www.7-zip.org/"
 class="external">7-Zip</a> as SFX.
